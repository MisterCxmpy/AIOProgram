# AIOProgram

AIOProgram is my biggest project yet. I wanted to make a program that has all of the features that I would want in a program.
It currently has over 1000 lines of code and includes a password generator, password vault, typing test, image capture,
image vault and a few more features.

Modules required:
  
  * Tkinter
  * ctypes
  * pyglet
  * PyQT5
  * Pillow
  * Numpy
  * cv2

How to use:

It is recommended that you create a folder and place the py file inside that folder.
Once you have done that run program.py and it will automatically create the needed folders for you.
